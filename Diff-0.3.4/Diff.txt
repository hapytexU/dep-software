-- | O(ND) diff algorithm in haskell.
--   
--   Implementation of the standard diff algorithm, and utilities for
--   pretty printing.
@package Diff
@version 0.3.4


-- | This is an implementation of the O(ND) diff algorithm as described in
--   "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations (1986)"
--   <a>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.4.6927</a>.
--   It is O(mn) in space. The algorithm is the same one used by standared
--   Unix diff.
module Data.Algorithm.Diff

-- | A value is either from the <a>First</a> list, the <a>Second</a> or
--   from <a>Both</a>. <a>Both</a> contains both the left and right values,
--   in case you are using a form of equality that doesn't check all data
--   (for example, if you are using a newtype to only perform equality on
--   side of a tuple).
data Diff a
First :: a -> Diff a
Second :: a -> Diff a
Both :: a -> a -> Diff a

-- | Takes two lists and returns a list of differences between them. This
--   is <a>getDiffBy</a> with <a>==</a> used as predicate.
getDiff :: Eq t => [t] -> [t] -> [Diff t]

-- | A form of <a>getDiff</a> with no <a>Eq</a> constraint. Instead, an
--   equality predicate is taken as the first argument.
getDiffBy :: (t -> t -> Bool) -> [t] -> [t] -> [Diff t]

-- | Takes two lists and returns a list of differences between them,
--   grouped into chunks. This is <a>getGroupedDiffBy</a> with <a>==</a>
--   used as predicate.
